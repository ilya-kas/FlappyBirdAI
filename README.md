# FlappyBirdAI
Just a project for fun. One of my typical one-evening ideas. <br>
It is a flappy bird game clone. But player's are not users but bots controller by neuronets. Those neuronets are training with genetics algorythm. There is also a version with a simulated annealing but it needs to be refactored so it is in private repository yet.
